The general idea behind my filtering was:

-Skip over any non-ip, tcp/udp packets
-Check tcp flags for 0 (NULL) and 41 (XMAS)
-Check the payload of every packet for:
	-Password leakage : (PASS)
	-Credit card info : four regexes for different credit card providers
	-XSS : script tags in a get or post request.
